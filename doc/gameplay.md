# Turn of Phrase Gameplay

Turn of Phrase is team game in which players take turns guessing short phrases.

## Number of Players / Assigning Teams

At least 4 people are required in order to play:
at least 2 evenly-divided teams of at least 2 people each.
More than 2 teams can be created if necessary or desired.

Examples:
- 4 people must be divided into 2 teams of 2
- 6 people can be divided into 2 teams of 3 or 3 teams of 2
- 8 people can be divided into 2 teams of 4 or 4 teams of 2
- 9 people must be divided into 3 teams of 3

It is still possible to play with 5, 7, or another prime number of people. However, not all players can participate equally.
It will require uneven teams
or a "free agent" player (see Variations below).

The easiest way to arrange the players so that turn-taking is natural
is to seat players in an alternating pattern.
In a game between Team A and Team B, players should be arranged in a repeating pattern ABABAB.
In a game between Team A, Team B, and Team C, players should be arranged in a repeating pattern ABCABCABC.

If teams are not even, it will not be possible to seat players in a perfect pattern. Try to get as close as possible.
A group of five could be seated ABABB.

## Equipment

Turn of Phrase is played with an electronic game device.

The game device consists of a virtual timer, scorekeeper, and a stack of phrase challenges.

On each phrase challenge is written a 1-3 word improper or proper noun phrase such as "refrigerator", "ice ax", or "The Lion King". Gerund phrases such as "cutting the cheese" could also be included.

Each phrase challenge also includes 4 additional related 1-2 word phrases. A challenge where the main phrase is "George Washington" might include "First", "President", "United States", and "Founding Father".

## Taking Turns

Teams take turns by passing the game device around the room.

With uneven teams, care must be taken while playing to ensure 
that all teams have the same number of turns.
For example, a group of five might be seated A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>B<sub>3</sub>.

One solution to ensure that Team A and Team B take the same number of turns despite the extra player is for
the two members of Team B sitting next to each other to act as one person
with respect to turn-taking. They can alternate who takes their shared turn each round.
Turns would be taken by A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, ... . However, this does mean that B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> take only half as many turns as B<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, or A<sub>2</sub>.

Another (more fair but more complicated) solution is to pass the device around the room in a more complicated pattern that ensures all members of a team participate equally. Interleave the pattern A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> with the pattern B<sub>1</sub>B<sub>2</sub>B<sub>3</sub> like so:
A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, ... .
Players of Team B now participate equally as often as each other, but still less than players of Team A.

## On Each Turn

On a player's turn, they begin by starting the timer on the game device.
The timer begins counting down near the top of the device screen,
below the score counts.

The phrase challenge at the top of the stack is presented to the player in the middle of the device screen.
The player must describe the challenge's main phrase to their teammates, trying to get one of them to say the main phrase.

Restrictions:
- The player must not say any part of the main phrase or any part of the related phrases on the challenge.
Ex: in the "George Washington" challenge example, a player could not say "The state of Washington is named after him." Exception: once the teammates have said a part of the phrase, the player may say that part.
- The player must not say any part of one of the related phrases. Ex: in the "George Washington" challenge example, one of the related phrases is "Founding Father". The player could not say "Establishing Father" because "Father" is part of one of the related phrases. Exception: once the teammates have said a phrase or part of a phrase, the player may say it.
- The player should not describe the spelling of the phrase. Ex: do not say "starts with G".
- The player must not describe the sound of the phrase. No "rhymes with" or "sounds like".
- The player should not use gestures.

Explicitly allowed strategies:
- Describing the meaning of the phrase.
- Giving synonyms that are not on the related phrase list.
- Giving antonyms that are not on the related phrase list. "Opposite of" is acceptable.
- Personal anecdotes are allowed. "We went to this city last Summer" is fine (though "city" might be on the related phrase list for some cities).

Once correctly guessed, the player swipes the challenge to the right or presses the green check button (below the phrase challenge and on the right) to reveal the next challenge on the stack.

If at any point the player violates one of the restrictions and is caught by a member of another team (who should be sitting nearby and monitoring), they must swipe the challenge left or press the red X button (below the phrase challenge and on the left).

The player can skip a challenge at any time (by swiping left or pressing the red X), even after they have begun trying to describe it.

When time runs out, the phrase challenges are once again hidden. The player confirms how many of the phrase challenges they were shown that their team correctly guessed (in case they made any mistakes while under the pressure of the timer). The team is awarded 1 point for each correctly guessed challenge.

The player passes the game devie to the next player.

## Winning

Winning is determined by a "first past the post" system that is modified in order to be fair to each team.

At the end of a turn, if the team that just played has reached or exceeded the number of points required to win (which is configurable),
the game has entered its final round.
Any teams which have had fewer turns than the team that breached the threshold are given 1 redemption turn,
during which they have an opportunity to score enough points to beat the team that breached the threshold.

In a game between Team A, Team B, and Team C:
- If Team A breaches the threshold, Team B and Team C are each given one more turn.
- If Team B breaches the threshold, Team C is given one more turn.
- If Team C breaches the threshold, the game is over and Team C has won.

After the redemption turns, the team with the most points wins.

## Variations / Configuration

Several game mechanics can be varied in order to create slightly different gameplay.
These settings are chosen before a game begins.

### Number of teams

As described above, the number of teams can vary depending on the number of players. Games with 2 or 3 teams are the most common. More teams are possible, but the math does not require it for any number of players less than 25.

### Number of points required to win

The number of points required to win can be configured depending on player preferences. 

### Penalty for skipping

A penalty of -0.25, -0.5, -1, or -2 points can be applied for skipping challenges are violating the restrictions of a challenge.

### Time limit

The default time of a turn is 60 seconds. It may be configured to any multiple of 10 seconds between
10 and 60, inclusive.

The time limit can be applied universally, or can vary by team or by player in order to provide a balancing handicap for different skill levels.
Ex: it might be nice to give a younger player more time than mature players. 

### Theme

The game device includes several sets of phrase challenges of various themes.
The phrase challenges presented in the stack come from the set selected.

Built-in themes include the following:
- General Knowledge
- Media (Music, Movies, TV)
- Play (Sports, Games, Hobbies)
- The World (Politics, Geography, History)
- Science

The device also allows the creation of additional themes if connected to the internet.

### Free Agent

One way of dealing with a number of players that does not easily accommodate balanced teams
is to designate one player as a "free agent" not belonging to any team.
This player never tries to describe phrases, but would guess phrases for either team.

There are two free agent variations:

- **Friendly free agent:** Phrases guessed by the free agent count towards the team's total number of phrases guessed correctly.
- **Antagonist free agent:** Phrases guessed by the free agent count against the team (or toward their number of skipped/failed challenged). This requires careful attention to who said the phrase.
